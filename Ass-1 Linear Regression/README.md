# Linear Regression Problem

Building a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes using a large dataset on daily bike demands. The project will also aim to determine:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands.
